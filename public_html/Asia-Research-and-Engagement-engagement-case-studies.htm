       <h1>Engagement examples from Europe</h1>

<p>The analyst role at TCAM was largely engagement oriented. Some engagement examples are written up in the TCAM Responsible Investment Annual Review 2009-10 and the TCAM Engagement review Q3 2010.  Case studies include:</p>

<h3>From the Annual Review 2009-2010</h3>
<ul>
<li> Labour standards in the supply chain (Unilever)</li>
<li> Employee Free Choice Act (various)</li>
<li> Responsible redundancies in retail (Marks and Spencer)</li>
<li> Bio accumulative chemicals – Bisphenol A</li>
<li> Backing bees brings business benefits (Bayer)</li>
</ul>

<h3>From the Q3 2010 Review</h3>
<p>Projects include all of section 1 on encouraging adoption of the Forest Footprint Disclosure, taking forward discussions around climate change and gender, and providing Johnson Matthey, Compass Group, and Spectris with in depth feedback in response to their consultation requests.</p>

<p>Aside from these Benjamin led the PRI collaborate engagement on senior gender diversity, alongside Pas World and Calvert. This was an engagement project with a team of nine investors and related to 54 companies.</p>

<h1>Engagement type activities in Asia</h1>

<p>The focus of work in Asia has been research, rather than ‘engagement’ per se. However, the research and other activities have been structured to create change and in many cases, company meetings were a source for the research. Consequently, the research output from Responsible Research and subsequently Sustainalytics is geared towards engagement, with recommended questions provided in the majority of reports.</p>

<p>It is also notable that many of the research reports relied on establishing networks and information gathering including from companies.</p>

<p>Other work included encouraging companies to participate in the Forest Footprint Disclosure Project and helping find speakers for events.</p>

<p>In March 2012, Responsible Research and Responsible Investors hosted ESG Asia 2012 at the Singapore Stock Exchange. Benjamin was responsible for a side event on green buildings at which delegates from CDL, CapitaLand, Keppel Land and Swire Pacific spoke.</p>

<p>In March 2013, ESG Asia 2013 was hosted again at SGX and Benjamin’s role was to structure the second day of the conference and find speakers from Asia – this can be a challenge as fewer Asians have the mandate or the training to speak in public than would be the case for ‘Western’ companies.</p>

<h1>Network in Asia</h1>

<p>ARE has direct contacts with companies. In addition, ARE has formal ties with Reputation Limited and Helikonia, which both have extensive client networks throughout the region.</p>

<p>ARE has affiliations with ACGA and CSR Asia and is connected with a number of other CSR consultancies.</p>

<p>Typically investor perspectives support increased work on CSR development. As ARE represents investors and does not work for (non-financial) companies directly, it is an advantage for CSR consultancies to provide access to their network to ARE.</p>

<p>In addition, ARE is well connected with the investors that deploy sustainable or responsible investment approaches across the region. This is a strong asset where collaborative approaches are likely to build the most traction and can also be leveraged to provide contacts with companies.
