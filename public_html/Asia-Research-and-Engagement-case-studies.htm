       <h1>CASE STUDIES</h1>

<h2>Case study 1 - Blue Book - Measuring ESG Footprints</h2>
 
<img src="images/Measuring-ESG-footprints.png" width="212" height="300" alt="an image of Measuring ESG footprints report front cover" style="float:left; margin:20px;">
<h3>The client</h3>
<p>Asia-based Investment bank CLSA provides investment research coverage for around 1000 companies across Asia Pacific.</p>
 
<h3>The problem </h3>
<p>The research team wanted to better understand how Sustainability would affect the companies they cover. How could analysts identify better or worse positioned companies?</p>
 
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>ARE developed a framework for analysing the relevant issues. This included top-down sustainability megatrends, sector specific factors, and general disclosure factors.  Working with CLSA analysts, ARE developed a set of questions for each sector to identify which companies were more likely to do well or poorly across a range of factors.</p>
 
<h3>The outcome</h3>
<p>CLSA published the research as part of their Blue Book range for top tier investors. The questions also informed the research process for CGWatch, CLSA's biennial report on corporate governance across Asia. Marketing of the two reports is ongoing.</p>
<br>
<h2>Case study 2 - Improving proxy voting practices</h2>

<h3>The client</h3>
<p>The Asian Corporate Governance Association (ACGA) is an independent, non-profit membership organisation that works with investors, companies and regulators to enhance corporate governance practices across Asia. ACGA comprises over one hundred members, the majority of which are institutional investors.</p>
 
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>Company general meetings provide investors the opportunity to elect directors and vote on many of the most important issues relating to their investments. However, flaws in the relevant regulation, delays in producing information, and errors in handling votes can frustrate investorsâ€™ attempts to exercise their rights.</p>
 
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>ACGA engaged ARE to write a report on the proxy voting process in each of 11 Asian markets with specific recommendations. The research is based on a review of regulation in each market, an investor survey, and interviews of investors and other participants in the voting chain. Alongside the research, discussion groups and events are building support and momentum for the necessary reforms.</p>
 
<h3>The outcome</h3>
<p>Initial research is complete, with a strong response from institutional investors that participated in the survey and interviews. The report is due to for publication in Q1 2015. </p>
